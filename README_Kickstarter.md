# Kickstarter Analysis

## Collective data on Kickstarters 

### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Used the data to research what categories/subcategories met goals/pledges. Overall view of what the outcomes were whether they were successful, failed or canceled. 

### Theater outcomes by launch date provided the data to support that the month with the highest success rate was in May. The failed rate was consistent throughout the months except for October. 

### For the theater subcategory had 1,031 outcomes. The data included goal ranges for the number of successful, failed and canceled outcomes. 

### Overall challenges consist of having too much data to analyze. Also include additional steps in converting certain information to make the data easily readible and disgetable. 

## Results

- May and June are top months to launch a successful Kickstarter. July and October had the highest failed rates. 

- Goal ranges such as less than 1000, 1000-4999, 35000-39999, 40000-49999 and 50000 or more had a success rate of 60% or higher. The range that had the highest failed rate was 25000 to 29999.

- No limitations. Just additional information in the data set that could have been removed.

- Create a bar graph to review the overall outcomes per category and subcategory. Additional line graph to review what country had the highest success rate.
